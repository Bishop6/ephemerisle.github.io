In the second year, Ephemerisle took place during July 23-25, 2010, in
the Mandeville Tip County Park on the [Sacramento – San Joaquin River
Delta](wikipedia:sacramento_–_san_joaquin_river_delta.html)
([<http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=207854270338809155245.0004864803082020221ed&ll=38.058837>,-121.539345&spn=0.047915,0.098791&z=11

This year, [The Seasteading Institute](http://seasteading.org)
officially abandoned the event about a month before it was to begin
because the insurance costs turned out to be around \$300/person. As a
community, we decided to show up anyway and create an unofficial
self-organized event, branded "NotEphemerisle". Despite the lack of
central organization, it still worked quite well, and around 120 people
showed up and had a great time.

Besides recreational activities, the event also hosted 12 "Memocracy"
talks.[1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/9055206@N06/5025171206/)
