title: What worked and what didn't in 2012
---

This is where we get to reminisce, celebrate, and constructively
criticize the 2012 event.

What worked?
============

What did we do that went well (as planned, or unexpectedly well)? Was
there something you particularly enjoyed or appreciated?

Matt

-   The Twin Logistical High Priestesses of Platform Construction,
    Kristy and Candace, did an amazing job. Our platform design scaled
    well, and construction and disassembly were very rapid. Lots of
    people pitched in to help with the construction process.
-   The Jellypuss was a bold imposition of artistic will upon the world,
    and the result was a lovely multisensory immersion. Jellypus +
    dubstep dance party was glorious.
-   The improved anchoring quality was the only reason we survived that
    rather epic storm.
-   The cuddle dome was an incredibly welcoming and inviting place,
    especially with Ping/Helen/Joanna's jellyfish hanging in the middle.
-   There were lots of people I cared about in the same place.
-   Given the weather issues we had, I'm glad the distance between north
    and west, as well as the distance between west and south ended up
    being enough to prevent an expensive and nasty collision. The north
    swung by a good 250 feet when the current shifted.
-   The 800-ft rope barge was really nice the day it ran. It would have
    been better if it were only 400 ft, but I'm impressed we could get
    it to work over such vast distances.
-   I learned a \*lot\* about real-time management, crisis management,
    and mediation.
-   I got to see some awesome people take on some big challenges.
-   The L-shaped city + platform was nice. It's much more social than a
    linear city, and easier to put together and anchor than the giant U.

Patri

-   Community spirit around the difficulties was strong.
-   The islands developed independent cultures.
-   Boats were individually self-reliant - taking care of themselves
    when they had to detach.
-   People were very responsive to helping with emergency situations.
-   While things didn't work perfectly, considering how challenging the
    environment was (water + high winds), we did pretty damn well.
-   Wider variety of vessels than in previous years.
-   Docking was done pretty well this year, I saw far fewer houseboat or
    speedboats dock bangily or need many approaches. I think the
    community is gaining greater piloting skill.
-   I found SMS very effective for communications.

Jessica Kay

I read all the stuff Patri put up here, and I concur with all of it. I
would also add:

-   Very Strong Volunteer Support – I’m not sure so many people jumped
    at opportunities in the planning phase, but when anything was
    needed, people jumped at it.
-   My boat, The Borealis, was pretty well prepared. We had a lot of
    coordination to plan meals, sleeping places, entertainment and costs
    beforehand. So far as I know, nobody was shorted, we backed each
    other up pretty solidly, theft wasn’t a concern, and as things came
    up we worked together to resolve them. Everybody contributed and
    everybody was supported in anything we wanted / needed (sometimes
    too much). We had a diverse set of skills that never left us looking
    for anyone to get things done.
-   I left a kayak sitting out all weekend and it didn’t once paddle off
    without my permission.
-   The houseboats were better stocked than I had imagined.
-   New Stuff – People got opportunities to learn and grow, and I saw
    them do it.

Clive

-   The platforms were awesome. it was so great to have so many of them
    this year!
-   When comms did work they were excellent using marine VHF
-   The default state of people is awesome
-   On the whole, things were really cool.

Adam

-   Having multiple islands was a mixed bag. From the weather it seems
    clear that the anchors would not have held a larger flotilla and the
    city would have been destroyed had it been all together. Also, it
    seemed like a very positive thing that the island developed
    different cultures and atmospheres. The downside was a big one -- it
    was very difficult for most people to get from island to island, and
    some of them never saw anything beyond where their boat was. Next
    year the community definitely needs to solve the transportation
    problem.

What could we do better?
========================

What decisions, in hindsight, would you now make differently? What made
the event less enjoyable for you? What would you do to improve it?

-   transportation between islands w/in archipelago.
-   emerging dictatorships
-   Communication and PA system and awareness about it.

Matt

-   I saw a hell of a lot more irresponsible drug use this year. I have
    nothing against \*responsible\* drug use, but if I have to attend to
    your stupidity because you thought a floating city in the middle of
    a windstorm is a great place to take too much LSD, I'm not going to
    be happy. The Sean Frenzy adventure was hilarious in retrospect but
    could easily have ended in him dying or in the coast guard searching
    everyone's boats and sending my responsible drug-using friends to
    prison along with the irresponsible ones. This outweighs every other
    concern by an order of magnitude.
-   City sections should have been 400ft apart in a triangle instead of
    800ft apart in a line. This should be far enough apart to prevent
    collisions but close enough to make transport easier.
-   Given that the city was in multiple sections, we didn't have nearly
    enough craft for going between sections.
-   We need a clearly designated docking area with a good bit of room
    for both hard and inflatable craft in each section.

Clive comments
--------------

striking while the iron is hot, I have the following thoughts:

First off, for as many smart people as we have, and all of the
participants are borderline genius, I saw some vastly stupid shit. Most
of this has to do with the inability to anticipate failure modes and to
optimize and plan processes.

Think every possible aspect of your process through. Do sub-scale
testing. Design things to be multiply fault tolerant. Anticipate that
your neighbor is going to be less prepared than you are. Plan your
motions to consolidate operations. Keep things flowing. Always have
multiple parallel paths, never plan for things to be done in series.

We could be a houseboat party or we could be Ephemerisle. It is up to
each participant to decide which he or she wants to be at. If you want
ephemerisle, it means you have to put in a fair bit of work at the
event.

Operations folks, operations. Be prepared to carry out quick, succinct
operations.

​1. Communications was horrible this year. I am working some angles to
have a more robust radio based comms system. The use of internet or
social media based comms is an incorrect application of that technology.
Mario radios are known devices and exist for a reason. At the very
least, each boat captain needs a radio, and I would prefer that certain
command ships and mobile boats have more powerful 25 watt units.
different cell networks reacted differently to the event.

​2. General construction expediency. Things didn't happen nearly as
quickly as they could have.

​3. Mooring/anchoring: For next year, I would love to set and test main
anchors for the event about two or three days before the main fleet
deploys. I am willing to head up this mission, but I will need skilled
nautical people to tell me what I am doing.

​4. An anyalytical approach to city design should be followed. I used to
write fluid sims for a living so this also is kinda up my alley, but
this could be the perfect opportunity for someone at TSI to do some
research into fluid dynamics of structures at sea.

​5. Some form of hierarchical organizational structure would be
beneficial through the construction and deconstruction phases of the
event. This structure would be dissolved during the course of the event.

​6. Anchoring, anchoring, anchoring, and lines. I was a complete idiot
and fought against the wiser folks at the start of this whole process
and pushed for a single-flotilla city. What a fool I was. We need to
determine our options vis-vi anchors and moors.

-   A small number of organizers like Paul Grasshoff on South seemed to
    take the brunt of coordination work. I'd like to see shifts of
    "central coordinator" (8 hours, maybe?) (and would happily do a few
    of them.
-   There was far too little supply of ferries for the demand. Just not
    enough ski boats. Michael Katsevman & I discussed introducing
    capitalism by having a paid ferry (maybe 3\$ inter-island, \$5 to
    H&H, \$10 to PP?). Then instead of needing people to donate ski boat
    rental time & energy, it would be paid by use. There are a lot of
    things we could do to improve this - use a patio boat for
    inter-island shuttling (greater cargo capacity), blow a "ferry horn"
    on docking rather than ad-hoc gathering people, use a whiteboard (or
    bidding!) to determine who gets the seats. We could pre-sell
    wristbands that entitle people to unlimited ferry rides (public
    transit!). Lots of ways to solve this, and I think that bringing
    some markets (paid services) in rather than the Burning Man
    anti-commerce spirit will scale a lot better. I'm potentially
    willing to organize this.
-   I felt that most of the downsides of the multiple island setup that
    was dictated by the anchoring and weather conditions came from lack
    of ferries and from unclear initial expectations. Having a shared
    understanding before the event that there will be multiple islands
    with unreliable transport would help people form islands based on
    shared culture, and have it be a benefit (unique aspect of the
    event) rather than an issue. Many of my friends were unhappy the
    islands were split.
-   Rope barge! (or canoe). It's an inter-island transport method that
    can deal with changes in the relative distance between islands due
    to shifting, unlike a solid bridge or hand-rope for swimmers. You
    just tighten/loosen the ropes periodically. And you don't get wet.
    And it doesn't need a pilot. If the barge is seaworthy, it's safe
    and you don't get wet.
-   We need to do a basic intro course in how to tie boats together. I
    am happy to teach this. The unexpected breakoff of two boats from
    South appears to have been due to a poorly tied houseboat-houseboat
    connection, plus the massive wind forces. One cleat-to-cleat tie
    loosened, the wind grabbed and turned the 2 boats, and the pressure
    snapped a cleat on the other end. I saw a lot of poorly tied cleats,
    and retied many throughout the event. It would only take 5-10
    minutes to teach a small group the basic principles.
-   We clearly need to think about safety policies for kayakers,
    swimmers, etc, and how to balance individual freedom with risk to
    the event. I saw problems both ways - group concern with things
    being handled fine individually, and individuals imposing group
    risk. Again, a few volunteers (particularly those with small vessels
    and/or radios) took the brunt of making the event safer by going and
    checking on swimmers, making sure small boats going long distances
    arrived safely, that sort of thing.
-   The base anchors need to be given lots of time to be set, with
    speedboat help, well in advance of anyone coming to anchor to them.
    It is a slow process to set good anchors, and it limits the
    formation of any island. Get the root vessels set up the day before
    anyone else shows up. Maybe they could start in the morning and
    others could show up at sunset, but no smaller gap seems workable.
-   If there is consensus on a single island being better than trying to
    make rope barges & ferries, we could consider getting a professional
    to make us a solid mooring point in advance, rather than trying to
    do it ourselves. This seems to be the single most key & most
    difficult infrastructure element for the event.

Dan Dascalescu
--------------

-   Very few people signed up for Memocracy micro-talks. Last year,
    someone circulated physically with a whiteboard and got people to
    sign up. That worked very well. This year, there was a Google Docs
    spreadsheet that only a few people saw. There's a lot of knowledge
    on diverse topics spread among Ephemerislers, and everyone can speak
    on something without much prep.
-   Water wasn't that cold, yet people didn't really play in much,
    compared to 2010. Moving the event later in the year, when the water
    is warmer, could encourage more water play.

Christie Dudley
---------------

I came in late and wound up sick, so have a limited exposure this year.
That doesn't prevent me from having Opinions.

-   Transport island/shore: There were a lot more people looking to get
    ferried out this year than we had ferries for. I see this as a
    positive sign of growth. It sounds like a growth industry to me.
    Were people who ran the ferry able to come out even or ahead? If
    not, we need more work on the ferry system than I thought.

-   Transport between islands: I never managed to make it from island to
    island this year. Although much of this was my own fault, it was
    tricky to manage transport between. Also, there were a number of
    people who I think got stranded because of misunderstandings of
    ferry service. It'd be great get this worked out so there's a more
    solid plan to address.

-   More defined roles: This crowd is full of volunteer spirit. Without
    better understood/defined roles, people were having a p-persistence
    problem. (You know where you step right and left in sync with the
    person you're trying to pass?) I think we can work things out so
    that people can volunteer to do tasks/shifts in a timely and
    efficient manner without imposing too much structure.

-   Suggested provisions: Communications could be improved if there were
    recommended radio make/models. Everyone would have good rope if
    there was some solid advice on what "good rope" is and how much of
    it would be good to bring. I'm betting all the captains would be
    sure to have everything if they knew what everything they should
    have entailed.

Adam's Anchoring Debrief
------------------------

​1) Paul W. and I were the Harbor Master team members on the scene as
the first houseboats started arriving. No one seemed to know which boats
were holding which anchoring supplies or when they'd be arriving. It
took hours to find the coil of 600' of rope, and we didn't find one
bucket of chain until Thursday midday.

For next year the Harbor masters for each section \_need\_ to be on the
first boat out for their section, and make sure that all of the
anchoring supplies for their section are on that boat.

Had harbor masters been on those first boats, with all necessary
supplies, anchoring would have happened much faster and the city would
have been put together Wednesday instead of Thursday.

​2) The tides are a bigger factor than we thought. As such, Paul Wheeler
decided that for safety sake we would have to move the city sections
further apart. The other harbor masters were not involved in this
decision as they were not present.

​3) Paradise Point upgraded their anchors from last year. 14lb danforth
anchors are a joke for boats this size. This year, most of the anchors
were 25lb which are still not sized appropriately for these boats, but
are a BIG step in the right direction. We spent \$140 for 3x25lb
Danforth which we didn't need, but we could not have guessed the marina
would upgrade their gear.

​4) Paradise Point also got new anchor lines, but these new thicker
lines are polypropylene, which degrades in UV light. We used this line
all over the place, but it should not be trusted for anything nautical.
If possible we really should use other lines for anything "mission
critical". Before next year's festival, we should call Paradise Point
and ask if they're still using polypropylene anchor lines.

​5) The 60lb anchors with chain and bridle performed magnificently. A
single 60lb anchor is not spec'd to hold 8 houseboats, and we should not
expect that it will do so again. But it did this year. The bridle also
worked as designed, and no cleats were pulled out even when a single
anchor was holding the entire South flotilla.

​6) Houseboats are crap. I was horrified to see that most of the cleats
are not even through-bolted, they're simply welded to the deck. I am
really surprised that only one cleat was ripped off. Also a lot of these
cleats have sharp edges to them, so they're going to gradually cut
through the lines. We may want to consider wrapping a bit of towel or
hose around the lines to protect them from these sharp edges.

​7) People please learn your knots. A good knot will not only hold
securely, but will also untie quickly and easily. Tying knot upon knot
upon knot, will probably hold things, but it's a mess to untie. And in
an emergency, it's important to be able to quickly release a line (see
the next note).

​8) Steak knives from the houseboat kitchens do a good job of cutting
through line.

​9) The VHF radios worked great. It's hard to imagine how we would have
done all of this without them.

​10) We want to keep the Coast Guard happy with us. The one request I
heard from them (2nd hand) was "anchor floats should be white". Let's
make that happen!

Ben Woosley
-----------

I suggest next year we take up the safest off-shore option ("One big
long raft" discussed here:
<http://ephemerisle.org/wiki/Ideas_for_2012#Layout_Discussion>), on the
theory that it's better to build out community from a stable base.

We could modify the single raft line by adding platforms on either end
on the leeward side, and adding a sheltering houseboat or two on either
side of them to protect from the wind. These could serve as social
center-points, ferry points for expedited travel, and (AFAIK) won't
significantly increase anchoring difficulty.

Tanya Jones
-----------

I agree that communication was key and a key failure mode. Our boat had
a marine radio for much of the time. I'd tried to pass it off to the
north for anchoring, but then it was lost for a pretty much all days. I
got it back during unloading. Labeling personal equipment in a durable
way is a good idea, especially since a tea light fire damaged the one
that was returned to me as mine, but was not actually mine. (Strap
caught fire, also damaged the housing; and Michael, let me know if you
want me to replace that unit....)

As for lessons learned, our boat, South \#1 Big Boat, held the main
anchor. We had to move it once, which was a major ordeal for everyone on
board. Upon leaving, we learned a cool new way to "unstick" a set
anchor, and I will definitely remember this for next year. The real
question will be whether or not I (or another captain) can successfully
reproduce those actions.

I am in favor of a pre-event knot-tying event. One of the risks of
quickly detaching the boats in high winds was that some of the figure
eight cinches on the cleats were actually clusters of knots. Everyone
should learn that one, and I also recommend a bowline as a good general
knot to learn. Having one representative from each boat is a good way to
ensure all boats will be safely and securely cleated, while still being
easy and quick to detach.

Stupidity or -- more kindly -- over-confidence, was a problem. I was
alarmed at the number of rescues that had to be performed after the
initial two, the two that prompted city-wide announcements. I realize we
will be discussing better transportation systems for next year; but my
one rule is absolutely no dying. We came scarily close to violating
that.

The emergence of different cultures across the city was fascinating. It
might be a good idea to implement a slightly different method for
organizing the sections of the city well in advance. Harbormasters
should be involved earlier, and perhaps boat captains can coordinate to
ensure they are in the section of the city that would make all their
guests happiest. This might result in interesting imbalances, if more
people want to be near the dancing or near the quiet. Hey, we all like a
challenge.

I don't believe anyone has suggested the possibility of a different
venue. Mandeville Point is quite accessible, but the weather this year
was more of an issue. It might have been the result of hosting the event
a month earlier, but perhaps there are options with more predictable
environmental conditions. Brad Templeton suggested a couple of
locations, one of which was Shasta Lake. Should we consider
alternatives? I would love to travel someplace new, especially if there
is greater access to houseboats.

Jessica Kay

The trouble with most of my suggestions is that they require order,
structure and a leadership command. I think one is necessary, though.

People were unprepared. As an organization- On water, you’re on your
own. Basically, that means that every boat should be able to deal with
any expected situation on their own. Other people might not be able to
reach them to do those things or provide resources. Before we left,
every boat should have had people who knew how to pilot and anchor the
boat, basic first aid training, a fire extinguisher that would put out a
class A (C02) and B (PKP) fire (and know how to use it) I don’t know
where those were or how to de-energize anything or disconnect the gas
and I’ve already been there and come home. How to correct that: First
Aid Training is Easy. Let the individual boats figure themselves out.
Two people can be the shipboard medics. Take a class from the red cross,
join a CERT. Give a class to everyone else…. Whatever works. Frankly, my
opinion is that everyone should have some basic training. I would push
to add in training for rescuing a drowning person, CPR, dealing with
high persons and the use of a SAM splint. Firefighting Training May be a
Little More Tricky. We could do a few classes before, probably. I’d bet
I could work something out, or even teach informally. It’s another basic
life skill. Piloting, Anchoring and that: Someone mentioned a dry run.
Someone else mentioned a pre-weekend trip. I like that.

Unprepared individuals – It’s been acknowledged already. I am concerned
that the people who came for the party will expect that it is the people
who throw the party’s job to take care of them if they need to get off
the island or do something stupid. It is our fault / responsibility if
they get hurt. Some thoughts on solutions: 1. I saw Patri’s proposal to
charge for boat rides. That would help 2. I was thinking of a sliding
scale cost for boat rides from the Marina, that goes up significantly
after the event starts, and even more for pickups after 5PM. 3.
Establish formal charters of the people on each boat, and only if a
person is on a charter, then they can come?

Kurt Schultz
------------

​1. Those lines that failed on North may have saved us more than we
realize. They may have protected our arrangement much the same as a fuse
protects an electrical circuit. Going to a higher strength of line for
that boat-to-boat docking function might lead us into larger problems
(like snapping cleats off).

​2. Anyone that operates a ferry service needs to be licensed by the
State of California to do so. I believe the license is required when
"three or more passengers" are being transported and there is a fee
involved.

​3. Transportation between islands sucked, but lashing into one big raft
would probably have been disasterous. Assuming that "rope barge" lines
are placed at future events, something needs to be done to make them
more visible. I was afraid that the Sheriff was going to foul their
propeller when they drove their boat between North island ans West
island.

​4. The event should have a "fall back plan" for the City Design. Once
boats were cut loose from North, we didn't know where to go.

​5. Cutting anchor lines may be expedient, but it proved problematic for
us afterwards. We were not able to splice an eye loop into the end of
the line after the loop was cut.

​6. Dave W. made the comment that it would have been usefull to have a
climbing rig, to secure him safely when he was 'over the rail', trying
to deal with mooring lines and anchor lines. Not sure that each boat
should have one, but I think it makes sense to have one good climbing
rig for at least each island. It's hard to work dexterously when one
hand is busy securing you to the rail.

​7. If you need to rely on a knife in an emergency, DO NOT rely on a
folding knife. For our purposes, we should have been carrying "Dive
Knives".

What did you learn?
===================

Is there any data you observed, or were there hard-won lessons you
gained, that will be useful in future years?

Patri:

-   Dynamic geography works, except when it doesn't :). Module size
    really matters - I ended up renting a small vessel for my family
    because my 20-month old needed more quiet for naps and bedtime than
    was available on any island. Mobility really matters - one of my
    most fun times at the event was motoring off in our little shipstead
    to have family dinner and quiet time for the kids to fall asleep.
-   Baron Hilton's groundskeeper gave us permission to MOOP sweep after
    we docked. Let's get it in advance next time.
-   Anchoring is hard.
-   Scaling is hard.
-   Small boats get really wet in choppy weather.
-   Having small kids at Ephemerisle is hard. In 2011 they came out Fri
    night. That was fine. Bringing them Wed afternoon was too much.
-   Lots more thoughts but I have lots of Ephemerisle laundry to do...

Bonnie/Yacht Club:

-   Paradise Point's literature states that the houseboats each come
    with a hammer, but they actually don't. This was a surprise to us,
    and would be useful information to distribute next year so people
    know to bring their own hammers.
-   My boat seriously failed at bringing enough rope. Rope seemed to be
    constantly in short supply, and even our "good" rope ended up
    breaking. The wiki should include links to good rope (and/or nylon
    webbing?), both something heavy duty for tying boats together, and
    also something lighter duty for tying up small inflatables and
    platforms. We should try to make it really easy for boats to show up
    with lots of good quality rope.
-   Attaching the bins to the main platform with nylon webbing seemed to
    work really well. I wish we had used nylon webbing for Lemonade and
    Lasers -- our platform started sinking a bit Saturday evening due to
    a couple of bins popping off.
-   The canopy we used for Lemonade and Lasers is fantastic and I
    recommend it highly. It survived the event unscathed, including
    people leaning on it for support and tying up craft to it, and
    eventually being pried off the platform with a hammer when the
    screws stripped. Good stuff:
    <http://www.rei.com/product/782087/caddis-aluminum-rapid-shelter-8-x-8>
-   I'd like to put some more effort into
    sustainability/recycling/MOOP/cleanup next year. Our boat didn't
    recycle any of our trash, simply because we failed to think about it
    beforehand so we didn't have separate receptacles for recycle or
    compost. We also would've happily participated in a trash sweep of
    the surrounding shores to pick up any debris that floated away
    during the event, but again, we just didn't think about it in time.

Jessica Kay

-   My Army tent \*can\* rip. It is not bulletproof. It is not even
    waterproof anymore. Sad face.
-   Setting up a rain fly to keep warmth in a tent so that there is an
    opening which is consistent with the flow of the wind will only work
    as long as the boat does not change directions.
-   Tying tent poles to various things to keep them from bowing in the
    wind was vital and I beleive prevented my poles from becoming
    damaged. I needed more reflective thingies to prevent people from
    tripping. I worried about that.
-   Boats change directions, even when anchored.
-   I learned more nautical stuff in the Navy than I thought I did.
-   Climbing gyms give away old rope for free and it's in really handy
    lengths.
-   Boobs will not fix everything.
-   I need a new drill.
-   I think I know how to drop an anchor.
-   I should have brought a spare air pump and patch kit for inflatable
    rafts.
-   Darryl gets pouty when I'm goofing off and his kayak is sinking.
-   I should take sinking more seriously.
-   Do not position paddles between boats or they will break. A once
    maimed, now straightened paddle seems to work okay.

Clive

-   Our boats are fueled with gas and not diesel
-   Wind loads are really bad
-   People are amazing and will step up when they need to
-   Sometimes a softer touch is needed
-   Bacon is tasty
-   Crappy ropes are crappy

Kurt

-   Bacon is my salvation; I shall not want.
-   It maketh me to lie down below levee roads.
-   It leadeth me to anchor in howling wind.
-   It restoreth my mellow.
-   It leadeth me into unusual adventures for adventure’s sake.

-   Yea, though I boat through the delta of windy death,
-   I will fear no starvation for thou art with me.
-   Thy smell and thy taste, they comfort me.
-   Thou augment my breakfast before me in the presence of toast;
-   Thou surmount my sandwich with condiments; my a ju cup runneth over.

-   Surely applewood and hickory smoked will succor me all the days of
    my life
-   and I will dwell in the house of Hormel forever.

Notional loadout for all houseboats for 2013
--------------------------------------------

This is a concept of a list of required items for each boat captain to
display before being allowed to raft up with the main floatilla. we can
hem and haw over it all year. Start by adding what you wish we could
have then we can slice it down to reality.

Each house boat/ static vessel
==============================

-   Marine Radio, proven functional - (this means VHF, ideally one that
    floats) 5 watts
-   Binoculars
-   [Decent knife
    <http://www.knivesplus.com/spydercoknifesp-c118syl.html>]- serrated
    a plus,
-   Copy of the ABCs of boating, captain proves at least that she
    skimmed it once.
-   100' of actual decent line
-   Power drill of some sort
-   Flood or spotlight. High-powered lights can be run off of 12VDC
    cigarette lighters. 12VDC cigarette lighter 'extension cords' would
    be needed for the houseboats.
-   Name, phone number, and boat number added to an event-wide
    spreadsheet

Each mobile unit (speed boat/bus boat)
======================================

-   Marine radio, 25 watt
-   Life ring (These, also known as Type IV PFDs by the USCG, are
    required by law, and all rented boats will have one. - Patri)
-   Spotlight
-   Very loud klaxon or megaphone

Command ships (one to three vessels depending on city design)
=============================================================

-   Same as houseboats BUT
-   Marine radio, 25 watts
-   FLIR system. I am working on a line for FLIR rentals (Clive)
-   rental night vision goggles
-   Pointing laser
-   Very loud PA/megaphone
-   Anemometer
-   Long range WIFI nodes
-   Zodiac or similar fast mobile vehicle
-   At least three crew members with their whole shit together willing
    to execute in shifts.
-   Mountain climbing sling, to secure workers that need to go "over the
    rail"

Matt's ideas for 2013
---------------------

OK... I'm going to propose some radical changes to the event. I'd be
interested in your feedback.

I think Ephemerisle should stop being a single event in almost every
way, and instead become a federation of independent events. It's true to
the spirit of decentralized government and self-reliance.

Thus the city becomes multiple villages. Each village starts in its
planning stages as a seed -- the seed consists of a single boat or a
small group of boats, and the groups in the seed decide who can join the
village. Each seed establishes a set of rules and required supplies for
others who want to add themselves -- some villages may require
knot-tying skills and certain amounts of rope; others may require
contributions to a DJ booth, still others may require a commitment to
pay some fair share of communal anchoring supplies. The seeds will grow
with distinct cultures, and villages will take on different
personalities.

Villages might get together to organize relative locations, rope barges,
radios, or ferries between cities, but they would be more like nations
in the UN than states in the US. Autonomy would prevail, and the global
governing body would be weak. We'd have to find a fair way of dividing
up the community supplies that have been funded with kickstarter so far,
but I don't think that's a huge challenge.

I think the main alternative to this is to return to the centrally
managed U shape of 2011, make it large enough to accommodate everyone,
and then tie it to the poles for safety. It's a known option and could
make for a nice 2013, but it's kind of boring.

I like that Ephemerisle is pushing people's limits. This year was the
first (somewhat accidental) experiment in competitive governance, and
I'd love to see it made official. We can experiment with the social
aspects of seasteading even in the small sandbox of Ephemerisle. Let a
thousand (floating) nations bloom... it's going to be a fun ride!
