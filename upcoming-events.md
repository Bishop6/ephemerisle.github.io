Please help organize these events, and set dates for them.

Media pow wow with TSI
======================

See the lengthy discussion on the [What worked](what-worked.html) page.

Ideas for 2012
==============

Our first pre-event meeting had a focus on event feedback. There should
be a following meeting with the specific focus on what we want to see
next year. See the page [here](ideas-for-2012.html) as a starting point.

Orientation
===========

There is an orientation meeting (primarily aimed at first-timers)
scheduled for February 12th, 2012. The event will be from 6:00 PM until
9:00 PM at 636 Santa Ray Ave., Oakland, CA. The event is a pot luck.
Bring your Ephemerisle ideas and your interesting friends (and vice
versa).

Design discussion w/ George Petrie
==================================

The Seasteading Institute's Director of Engineering George Petrie has
offered to consult on a project for next year if there is a team
interested in designing/building a small model of future seastead. For
example, he could coach the building of a small semi-submersible
platform such as those showcased on our website, which could be used a
community space for future Ephemerisles.

Safety class(es)
================

A class to expand and distribute knowledge about first aid and boating
safety through more of the community.

Boating class(es)
=================

A class to expand and distribute knowledge about boating, particularly
knot tying and anchoring, through more of the community.

Build days

Experimenting and learning how to build floating platforms, basic boats,
art boats, etc.

dome, 701 Beryl Place, Hayward, CA. All day long. Come to work, come to
feed the workers or just come to sunbathe.

Art days

Days with a focus on expanding the aesthetic rather than engineering
aspects of the event.
