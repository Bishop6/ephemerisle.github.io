title: Plans to do more in 2013
---

For the record the event is in San Joaquin County and as many have seen
by now, the front line law enforcement is the county sheriff.

If anyone has ideas they think the local constabulary might care about,
it would probably be good to coordinate our efforts. Having several
small groups coming to them about the same event not aware of each other
would make us look irresponsible. In coordination, not only would we not
have to explain everything from the beginning, it'd give them the image
that we're aware and in control.

Fire art
--------

I'm planning to contact the Sheriff's office in the coming months to
discuss the local regulations surrounding fire. I've discussed with
Clive (among others) the possibility of having fire art, along the same
lines as the Jellypus. I have not yet found any specific regulation
covering fire, although that's not to say that none exist in some buried
section of the code. Regardless, it'd probably be best to alert the
Sheriff's department lest they respond to reports of unexplained
sustained fire by calling out the fire brigade.

If anyone has any experience and/or insight into NFPA 160, an
international standard covering flame effects in front of an audience,
I'd like to talk.

Bus Ephemerisle
---------------

We need a 10 person art ferry for the specific purpose of looping around
the city carrying passengers and cargo.

Who wants to help with this?
