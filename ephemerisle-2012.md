title: Ephemerisle 2012
---

Ephemerisle 2012 took place from June 6 to 10 at Mandeville Tip, the
same location as the previous year. The event grew significantly this
year, with houseboats and sailboats numbering at least 25 and attendance
estimated around 300. This year we experimented with a city in three
separate sections and a more complex anchoring plan, we built two
community platforms as large as the 2011 platform, and we faced much
tougher winds than we did in 2011.

Fundraising efforts
===================

-   [Central
    Platform](https://www.wepay.com/donations/central-platform-2012)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - Bring back the Central Platform from last year
    and expand it to be 24'x28'.
-   [Cuddle Platform /
    Gallery](https://www.wepay.com/donations/ephemerisle-cuddle-gallery)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - Ephemerisle needs a space where community members
    can chill out, cuddle among friends, admire art, practice yoga, and
    talk about all the great ideas that our floating festival inspires!
-   [Anchoring](https://www.wepay.com/x104yv4/donations/ephemerisle-communal-anchoring-supplies)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - This has been a problem in the past at
    Ephemerisle. We met our original goal. Now we're looking for a
    couple of hundred extra dollars for additional rope and chain. Help
    ensure Ephemerisle literally doesn't get blown away.
-   [Jellypus](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/22415368/jellypus-floating-flashing-art-thing-take-2)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - a massive underwater octopus like light show.
    There is a [second round of
    funding](https://www.wepay.com/donations/jellypuss-round-two) to
    cover extra costs to the project.
-   [Lemonade and
    Lasers](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1346841808/lemonade-and-lasers-floating-art-platform)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - a floating lemonade stand with lasers.
-   [The Amphibious Red
    Couch](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1409302307/the-amphibious-red-couch)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - a Bicycle-Pedal-Powered Paddlewheel Pontoon Couch
-   [Performers and equipment
    fund](https://www.wepay.com/donations/radio-fmerisle-saturday-night-dance-party)
    - support the Radio FMerisle Saturday Night Dance Party. About
    \$1,400 in expenses paid out-of-pocket and the event was cancelled
    due to high winds. Still time to donate, if you want to express
    appreciation for Rion Fish's Friday evening performance.
-   [Speed Limit
    Signs](https://www.wepay.com/donations/ephemerisle-speed-limit-signs-project)
    **TIMED OUT** - temporary floating speed limit signs, to warn
    boaters to slow down near Ephemerisle. These signs will be reuseable
    for years. Overly-optimistic; signs were not stable in high wind.
-   [Well deserved
    rum](https://www.wepay.com/donations/well-deserved-rum) **FULLY
    FUNDED** - send bottles of rum along to Paul Wheeler and the two
    people (who despite not being able to attend Ephemerisle) loaned us
    the big expensive 60lb anchors.
-   [Repay for Paul's Cut
    Anchor](https://www.wepay.com/donations/paul-wheeler-s-anchor)
    **FULLY FUNDED** - Paul lost an anchor at some point; most likely
    someone motored over his anchor line. Adam found a nice used anchor,
    but let's get this and his bottle of rum.
-   [Platform Storage](https://www.wepay.com/donations/platform-storage)
    - rental on the storage unit for the platforms
