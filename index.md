Ephemerisle is a floating celebration of community, learning, art and
seasteading.

We construct a floating city on the Sacramento River Delta and live on
it for five days. Ephemerisle has elements of Burning Man in the early
1990s: a new adventure into an alien environment, with discoveries,
adventures, and mishaps along the way.

There are no tickets, no central organizers, and no rangers to keep you
safe.

*Seasteading*:

Seasteading seeks to move human communities out into the vast expanse of
our planet covered in water. Ephemerisle gives an introduction into the
physical challenges of being water and learning ways to deal with them.
It also provides for small scale experimentation in differing forms of
governance.

*Art:*

A society without art has no soul. We need to have art, beauty, and
creativity in our lives.

*Learning*:

We thrive off of sharing knowledge and learning from one another.
"Memocracy" micro-talks have been a core of the event. Ephemerislers are
now teaching clinics in anchoring and other boating skills. Learning by
doing is also key.

*Community*:

Ephemerisle is an event that doesn't happen unless we build it together.
Everyone should be contributing.

Never board a boat without asking first as according to the ancient laws
of the sea, each captain is sovereign over his vessel. But the default
assumption at this event is that you will be welcomed aboard.


Ephemerisle 2014 - July 14-20
-----------------------------
Again, there were two islands, with speedboat and jet ski service gracefully provided by several kind folks, especially Randolph Hencked of The Seasteading Institute.

In 2013, Ephemerisle reached a size where it made sense to break into
autonomous Islands for logistical and other reasons. Now the event needs
more boats, preferably art boats, to move between these islands.

In 2013, the Ephemerisle community broke up into fully autonomous
islands. It would greatly add to the sense of community and help
communication if you add your islands to the list of [2013
Islands](2013-islands.html).

The main discussion is on the [facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/notephemerisle/) and the 2013
event is [here](http://www.facebook.com/events/374789335951171/).

The water can be very dangerous. Read the [Survival
guide](survival-guide.html)!
