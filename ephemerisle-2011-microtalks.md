Erin Rapacki - Where's my robot
-------------------------------

-   general-purpose robots don't exist yet mainly due to insurance
    issues: what if a 3rd party makes a robot hit someone, who's
    responsible?

Daniel Ford - phylogenetics - the math of evolution
---------------------------------------------------

-   conserved portions of the DNA are conserved because changing them
    would cause an organism's death
-   these sequences are the core of how life works

Tobias
------

-   we don't have more freedom by coming here on the water
-   we compress the freedom into very few things around us and we depend
    on the entire economy that allows us to have here the luxuries of
    the land
-   there's a huge amount of work and limitations when living on the sea
-   you need all sorts of skills to maintain your boat, grow food, sail
    etc.

Chris Hjelmfelt - Survivalism on the Water
------------------------------------------

-   Separating real need from perceived need
-   Doing without everyday luxeries
-   Living away from our natural habitat (land)

Max Peto from SENS
------------------

-   [LysoSENS](http://www.sens.org/sens-research/research-themes/lysosens)
-   works on age-related macular degeneration
-   junk accumulates in lysosomes and there's nothing to break it down
-   lysosomes end up accumulating cholesterol
-   when the cholesterol in the lysosomes breaks down, there's no
    antioxidants there to break it down

Jean - Open Health & self-tracking
----------------------------------

-   working on a brain training game to improve focus
-   the best thing to prevent neurogenerative disease is exercise

David Pablo Cohn - How to get a job at the South Pole
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Went to the South Pole as a support guy
-   Antarctic tours - \$35k (you don't want to do this)
-   Or you can get there with a National Artists & Writers grant
-   as a scientist, you apply to NSF, wait a few years, then go there
-   as a support guy for the scientists -
    [rayjobs.com](http://www.rayjobs.com/) (from defense contractor
    Raytheon)
    -   best way to get into the system is to know someone in the
        system; face-to-face contact is everything
    -   Antarctic program usually has job fair in March for the Oct-Feb
        "summer season"
-   Summer population @ South pole is 180-200 support folks, \~40
    scientists
-   Tech talk and lots of details at
    <http://www.somerandom.com/cohn/pablo-at-the-pole>

    solving

Michael Clive - Rockets
-----------------------

-   "any of you can go into space in the next 10-20 years"
-   "what the space race is missing is capitalism"
-   "space is not much of a location, but a velocity: you have to go
    about 17k mi/h - orbital velocity, to not come down; to leave the
    earth, you have to hit escape velocity
-   suborbital services
    -   research on zero-gravity stuff
    -   tourism

If you are interested in space, Scott and Michael are putting on an
unconference in Los Angeles in August - <http://www.SpaceUpLA.org>

Gerry Deckert - Social computing
--------------------------------

Replacing social networking with social computing

-   Problems:
    -   Data ownership and privacy
    -   Functionality dispersed over many sites
    -   Data duplicated over many sites

Daniel Finfer - [The Posthuman Era](http://www.posthumanera.com/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   Record labels take 80% of the profits
-   cool song playing - "Build the machine", about building an AI

Zach Lash - Tallships

-   have tall masts
-   low-tech, ropes=lines
-   sextants, navigate by the stars and dead reckoning
-   the tech of tallships has been refined for over 1000 years
-   sailtraining.org - ASTA (American Sail Training Association)
-   International Sail Training Association - deals with European
    vessels

Ashley - [Cannabinoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   we have endocannabinoid receptors, because during childbirth it
    interferes with the pain to memory pathway, which helps you forget
    the pain of childbirth, so you do it again. THC.
-   THC gives you more of the head high, and CBD body high

Michael Bennett - living on water full-time
-------------------------------------------

-   Q: how easy is it to sneak into another country?

`A: surprisingly easy, and high penalties for it`

-   Q: What about food?

`A: water provides a large degree of protein. E.g. in the tropics, you can catch a year's worth of protein in a day.`

-   Q: What about community?

`A: Yes, but it's loose and transient. Most are so independent you need to knock on their door.`

-   Q: What about logistics?

`A: In the Bay Area it's pretty simple, but there are pretty annoying anchoring laws, so I'll be hitting back to Mexico in fall. I can store 6 months worth of dry goods and canned goods. If you sail a lot, you can fuel it 2-3 times a year. In Mexico, food is much cheaper. Water makers are fairly expensive, but fresh water (your most serious commodity) is not expensive.`

-   Q: What about cost?

`A: I lived on $500/month for 2 years. Maintenance is important, and upgrades. Technology for marine systems, even though fairly robust, just doesn't last. If you invest in the boat before you leave port, you can live off $500 for food and fuel.`

Christie Dudley - Politics of hacking(?)
----------------------------------------

-   makes stuff, focus on work with electronics
-   hacking is the act of making things to do things they weren't
    intended to do
-   HAM radio operators actually control more RF spectrum than any
    entity other than the military. This is surprising, considering how
    loos of a group they are.

Richard - The [basilisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk) meme - on social science
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   interested in anthropology
-   Who knows what a meme is? [Less than 30% of the audience.]
-   mythological creatures from the bestiary have persisted generation
    after generation
-   location and crypticity must be vague, so the hypothesis is much
    more difficult to defeat
-   e.g. unicorns only approach virgins
-   the basilisk - when you see them, you die and turn to stone; so you
    can never confirm or deny with your own eyes

Chris Rasch - [Wishforge](http://wishforge.com/)
------------------------------------------------

-   How many of you are in favor of pot legalization? About 30% of the
    audience raised their hand.
-   donate to "potprize"
-   pot prize sells bonds
-   activists buy bonds, which will sell cheap because of the
    uncertainty
-   now activists are incentivized to lobby
-   if they fail, the bonds expire worthless, and money returns to
    donors
-   you don't have to identify the people who can make a difference;
    they'll identify themselves because they'll buy the bonds
-   Q: if it becomes legal, then the people who put up the money will
    have to pay out

`A: the money is put into escrow, so it will be paid out`

Chris Rasch (\#2) - mind hack: cravings vs. losing weight
---------------------------------------------------------

A way to kill the craving: buy the Twinkie, chew it, and spit it out.
After you've done that, you won't have a craving for it any more. You
don't eat its calories. Google: "[cue exposure
therapy](http://www.google.com/search?q=cue+exposure+therapy)".

Kevin - multiverse
------------------

Why are we here? This has been the domain of religion for a really long
time.

Keynote - Brian McQueen on [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   project by Satoshi Nakamoto - it's not his name, but a makeup of
    Japanese company names
-   a single global currency beyond the reach of politicians or bankers
-   distributed, can't be shut down
-   over 180k computers generating and validating bitcoins
-   85 petaflops of computing power going towards bitcoin validation
-   back in January were going go 30 cents, now for \$30, 100x
-   market cap: \$143M
-   it's much easier to get an Internet business going - you just
    establish a bitcoin vault
-   bitcoins will be created at a known, predictable rate until 2140
-   there is a transaction ledger, so it's not anonymous
-   not a panacea for getting away with illegal activities
-   Charles Schumer has called for an investigation of Bitcoin
-   [silk road](http://www.google.com/search?q=silk+road+bitcoin)
    website selling guns and drugs
-   getting into bitcoin is hard, unless you wire money to a bank and
    buy BTC
-   mtgox.com, tradehill
-   it's bad for the concept if it's all about porn, dope and guns
-   we need to get regular people to use the system
-   BTC is great for international money transfers, vs. currencies
-   BTC will allow true microfinancing: donate a penny to a cause

Keynote - Patri
---------------

-   the cruise ship test: The Seasteading movement focuses on what
    doesn't pass the cruise ship test: legal research, engineering on
    building things that are better than boats, can expand and connect
    to each other, and withstand storms. What passes the cruise-ship
    test: how will you produce energy, or provide food.

Tim Potter - Seasteading with waste materials
---------------------------------------------

-   island build of plastic bottles in bags, with plywood on top
-   mangroves on the sides, with roots going through to the water
-   mangroves resist hurricanes, and they did just that 5-6 years ago
    when his island was hit by a hurricane

Bobby from Ithaka (bhopter@gmail) - rethinking digital trust networks
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-   problems with the couchsurfing network:
    -   all trust is global, but a person disliked by someone can be
        liked by you
    -   on Cocuchsurfing, even if you didn't like your tenant, you still
        give them a decent review, because otherwise would be a giant
        "fuck you"
-   eBay, Couchsurfing = global trust metrics
-   proposal: local trust networks
    -   trust tags
    -   designate confidantes = people you share information with, and
        whose opinion you weigh some percentage (maybe they just love
        everyone)
-   A slightly out-of-date (but more detailed) writeup can be found
    [here](http://sharewiki.org/en/Distributed_Trust_Network_Proposal).
-   The development portal is now at [raincode.org](http://raincode.org)

Dan Dascalescu - [The Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   The Quantified Self is a group of users and tool makers interested
    in self-tracking with the goal of improving aspects of our lives
-   personal science matters because we are all different and
    large-scale studies may not apply to us, or what works for us may
    not work for the population at large
-   recent explosion in sensor technology - [accelerometer sensors in
    stickers](http://greengoose.com) let you track the most unexpected
    things, like how often you use your toothbrush, water bottle, or
    fridge door
-   sharing data you have a goal for, makes you more likely to attain
    that goal
-   see the [notes from the Quantified Self conference in May
    2011](http://qswiki.com/index.php/QS_Conference_2011)

Alex Peake - Code Hero

-   future: Nano Hero, fighting gray goo; Bio Hero, building proteins

Jelena - intro to massage
-------------------------

-   5th generation massage therapist
-   basics of Swedish massage: long strokes, tapping etc.
-   but there's an even simpler way:
-   avoid creepy touching
-   just put your hand lightly on them and let them get accustomed
-   then, just poet them a little bit
-   start with something familiar: stroking
-   use the flat of your hand and just stroke
-   failure: too much pressure, or tips of fingers
-   so maximize surface area
-   use palm and fingers together
-   mold your hand to their body shape
-   simple circle around half the back
-   variations in a move: pressure, speed, shape (circle, line etc.),
    size (focal point vs. large surface area)
-   please ask for feedback
-   do variety

Max Marty - Microexpressions (reading emotions)
-----------------------------------------------

Who's seen Lie to Me? The hero can read people's emotions really well.
He rents himself to FBI and other groups. How many think they're really
good at spotting lies? (very few) Science has disproved that you can
tell from where someone's looking if they're conjuring up an emotion or
inventing something.

You can look at: voice, body, face. The eyes are really not the window
to the soul, save for detecting if someone's paying attention to you.
Body language is useful to figuring out a baseline. Look for a change
when you're looking for something in particular.

Paul Ekman on microexpressions: anger, sadness, contempt, happiness,
diosgust, surprise, fear - the 7 basic emotions. Two of them correlate
70% of the time with lying: contempt and disgust. We don't know exactly
why that is. Look online for a program called "FACE", that trains you to
recognize microexpressions.

Becca Gorman - freedom of children
----------------------------------

-   unifying value here: we believe in freedom
-   a person can't own property, can't choose their education or where
    to live based on an arbitrary metric - how many times the Earth has
    gone around the Sun
-   but, people say, it's not that, but capability
-   but, if we go by that logic, we should permit people to make
    decisions based on their capacity, not age - but we don't do that
-   what do we consider capable? What makes our values better than other
    people's?
-   When we build a seastead, we should re-evaluate the status of
    children from the ground up. Think of a reason that was used to
    treat children differently from adults, that was not used to treat
    slaves differently.

Alex Jacobson
-------------

-   Is what you're doing with your life worthwhile? (good crowd).
-   works in venture capital. One way to evaluate a company is to assess
    the value they give customers: fear, hope, greed, despair. At
    planetary level, are you addressing planetary fear, hope, greed or
    despair? E.g. on the greed team: how would we go about consuming the
    resources of the galaxy? What theme are you on?

Starchild - evolution, spirituality and non-aggression
------------------------------------------------------

-   the non-aggression principle - the idea that you have the right to
    live however you want to, as long as those choices don't involve
    initiating force or fraud against others
-   expand the principle from humans to animals and the entire universe
-   "A physicist is an atom's way of learning about atoms".
-   we think of ourselves as unitary intelligences, but DNA is another
    form of computation, which does learn things over a long period of
    time
-   imagine a world in which you don't have to kill to survive

Randy Hencken - compassion, harm reduction, and drug abuse
----------------------------------------------------------

-   my oldest friend died of a heroin overdose
-   before TSI, I was involved in drug policy reform
-   before that, I was involved in drugs
-   why having a better policy on drugs can help people
-   this summer it's been 10 years since I've kicked heroin
-   what helped me get off heroin was the harm reduction movement, and
    people with compassion
-   those people helped me get clean, they took me to a hospital when I
    was sick, gave me clean needles
-   the reason my friend died from an overdose is because his girlfriend
    was scared to call the police, and now she has to live with that
-   you can beat an addiction but you can't beat a conviction

Terry Floyd - the platform behind us
------------------------------------

-   activist with the libertarian party, into
    [Oceania](http://oceania.org/)
-   idea of connecting hexagonal platforms together
-   talked into going with squares this year, but it didn't work very
    well, so back to hexagons next year
-   [Buckminster
    Fuller](http://www.google.com/search?q=Buckminster+Fuller)'s dome

Kate Compton - Procedural Generation: Creating Worlds
-----------------------------------------------------

-   does visual work for Maxis: "procedural generation" - running
    simulations that can generate content (mountains, landscapes; e.g.
    Bryce)
-   most recent: the Spore game (she did all the 4 billion planets)
-   example: how does each curly strand of hair get curled in the same
    way
-   mountains: built up by volcanic action, then affected by erosion
-   what if you tweak these rules? You get Science Fiction. E.g. what if
    rivers instead of meandering, would dig channels?

Anastasia Krylov - the sexual revolution of our times
-----------------------------------------------------

-   born in USSR, currently based in LA
-   full-time sushi chef; also dominatrix, sex educator
-   founder of kinky non-profit in LA, TSX
-   the non-profit teaches 5 classes: health, kink, non-monogamy, gender
    spectrum and identity, how society influences our sex lives.
-   overarching theme: communication. we live in a society that values
    non-communication. Action movies are about people who don't
    communicate and look cool. Or, other movies show that people who
    talk too much are not cool but dopey. Or, romantic movies show
    couples just looking at each other, and not using words much. In our
    society, the default is not to communicate. "Communication is
    fucking key."

Cyprien Noel - Next generation concurrency
------------------------------------------

-   from France, arrived in California a few months ago
-   we are getting more CPU cores, but we don't really know how to
    program them
-   one way we have is to use locks, but this is hard to program and not
    scalable
-   other ways: use message passing, actors, functional programming. But
    you lose OOP.
-   transactional memories: get a resource, work on it, then commit
    changes
-   distributed transactional memories: same process, but it can be used
    among many machines - this is the next big paradigm, after
    procedural and OO programming
-   The European union recently funded [CloudTM](http://www.cloudtm.eu/)
-   Other implementations: DiSTM, DMV, and Cyprien's own:

Christine Peterson - "finding a life partner" lecture
=====================================================

Only about hetero long-term relationships, no gay, no poly. Advice aimed
primarily at women looking for a life partner, based on the book "[Love
in 90 days](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599951231)"; written for
women but men can act on it.

At work, you have to pretend men and women are similar. But in mating,
we will look at the animals. Reptilian brain, mammalian brain.

Oxytocin is the cuddle/attachment hormone. You want this hormonal
cascade, which does happen, but rarely. It was fun even
unidirectionally, when she had it for the guy,

Recent finding: when men and women have sex, the woman's oxytocin level
goes up, she gets attached, and stays up. But men's goes down after 30
minutes. This explains one-night stands, and the man who lives with a
woman for year, but then he dumps her; the man who has a mistress,
divorces wife, but doesn't marry mistress either.

Just having sex doesn't do it for these guys; sex doesn't cause bonding
for men.

In general, the male is pursuing the female. The other way doesn't
really work that well. The moralistic and religious rules have a
chemical basis. The old rule for women was "play hard to get", because
men like to chase women, men want women in high demand/status.

Women should establish non-negotiable criteria for what they want in a
life partner: for example, a particular ethics, and no history of mental
disease.

Spectrum disorder: there's a gradual difference between mental health
and mental disorder. You don't want a partner with a spectrum disorder,
which is common among people with high IQ (Christine went to MIT),
because your kids might get it worse.

Women, prepare for the hormonal cascade: meet the family, establish
there's no mental illness. Establish your criteria and do the weeding
first, before the hormonal cascade starts.

Christine thought she'd end up with a libertarian life extensionist. But
the man she'll be marrying next month is not like that.

The other person brings out the best in you.

Contrary politics can get sexy: "say something liberal" ;)

"Ladies, you date 3 men at a time." More is too hard, and less is more
difficult to compare. By doing that, you compare real men. You keep
letting go the least promising guy, and get a new one.

OKCupid is the only site that tells you when the person last logged on.
On the other sites, ping/wink the person. Men are frustrated because on
those other sites, women are not there any more, but the site lists them
anyway, so they don't send carefully crafted e-mails.

Women, how to trigger dopamine-producing activities: spend time alone,
do anything emotional, scary: skydiving, movies; let him show off or pay
for you. Men have a showing off response and a caretaking response. Make
sure he knows you're seeing two other guys. She's not \*playing\* hard
to get; she's genuinely not sure, that's why she's dating other guys.
Christine was dating an intellectual libertarian, when she realized she
loved the other guy.

Don't give him an orgasm for a while, so he won't go through that crash.
Forcing the wait is part of reeling them in.

By delaying sex, the woman can avoid becoming attached and triggering
the hormonal cascade that clouds judgment.

"Dating" is seeing other people; "relationship" is with one person at a
time.
