title: History of Ephemerisle
---

The event was conceived of in 2001 by Patri Friedman as an incremental
path towards self-governing seasteads, [here is the original & highly
dated website](http://patrifriedman.com/projects/ephemerisle/). The
first event was organized in 2009 by the Seasteading Institute
(http://seasteading.org/)) to promote the cultural concept of
seasteading - the construction of autonomous floating nation-states - in
a hands-on and accessible way. TSI bravely did this event with no
insurance the first year.

In the second year, TSI decided not to sponsor the event about a month
before it was to begin because the insurance costs were too high (\$500
- \$1000/person). As a community we decided to show up anyway and create
an unofficial self-organized event. Despite the lack of central
organization, it still worked quite well, and around 120 people showed
up and had a great time.

For 2011, there were no central organizer, but things came together
great for another Not-Ephemerisle Event.

After the 2011 event, TSI officially handed over the Ephemerisle name to
the community, and the event has continued gloriously ever since.
