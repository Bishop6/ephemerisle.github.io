Floatation Research
===================

This page describes various methods of floating a large (\~20'x20'),
stable, and safe platform for public use at Ephemerisle.

Design constraints:

-   Use materials that are as inexpensive as possible while still being
    reliable.
-   Favor reusable materials over one-time-use materials that will be
    discarded.
-   Build a platform that is continuous and relatively rigid over its
    entire size, as opposed to made up of free-floating segments.
-   The platform must be launchable from a boat, and therefore modules
    must be connected together primarily in the water. All fastening in
    the water must be doable from the top (e.g., no underwater bolt
    fastening). Also, as much construction work as possible should be
    done prior to loading the materials on the boat that will be used
    for launch (e.g., no caulking at final assembly time).

-   Cons: Flimsy, can crack, and tops can pop off if not secured, may
    not provide enough flotation, may leak if not sealed with sealant or
    plastic bag.
-   Cost: 20lbs of lift per \$

    Easily available], cheap, stackable for transport, solidly built,
    can possibly tape buckets together into pontoons.
-   Cons: Low floatation per bucket; will need lots of buckets. Leak.
-   Cost: 12lbs of lift per \$

5 gallon buckets (take 2, with gasketed lids)
---------------------------------------------

-   Pros: Easily available, cheap, stackable for transport, solidly
    built, can possibly tape buckets together into pontoons, and they
    can be gotten for free. Gasketed lids (\$1.25-\$2.50) can used to
    provide a water tight seal.
-   Con: It takes lots of buckets to float a platform.
-   Cost: 30lbs of lift per \$ with free bucket and lids bought in
    quantity. 10lbs of lift with retail home depot buckets and lids from
    ace hardware.

55 gallon barrels
-----------------

-   Pros: Can be found for free, rock solid.
-   Cons: Big, heavy, hard to transport, will leak if not sealed, must
    carefully seal and test *pre*-event.
-   Cost: \$0

EPS Foam
--------

-   Pros: Can be ordered in custom sizes, no problem with leakage,
    [reasonably
    priced](http://univfoam.com/pricing-calculators/eps-pricing),
    relatively easy to attach.
-   Cons: \$250 minimum order. Takes up quite a bit of space for
    transport and storage.
-   Cost: 10lbs of lift per \$.
