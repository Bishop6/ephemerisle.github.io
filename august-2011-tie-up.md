HAZARD - For anyone coming in your own boat, please note that the
southern 2/3 of the entrance is extremely shallow (less than 3').

Safety
------

-   Lifejackets - please bring a life jacket. Even if you're a good
    swimmer, the cold water makes being out there extremely dangerous.

-   Whistle - Attach a whistle to your life jacket. In you fall in cold
    water, you may struggle to call out for help. A whistle makes a
    loud, distinctive noise, with little effort. This is a \~\$2 item
    which could save your life.
