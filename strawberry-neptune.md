Mission Statement
-----------------

"This is a mishmash gathering of amazing people who, once there, will
work their magic and have everything they need or want. It will be
bliss!"

Introductions
-------------

Let us get to know each other a little before we set sail. Use this
thread to introduce yourself: [StrawberryNeptune:
Ahoy!](http://groups.google.com/group/StrawberryNeptune/browse_thread/thread/12f35a30ccb3f356)

How to pay & how much
---------------------

\$140 per person for sleeping aboard a boat. Please pay your captain at
the event.\
Cash or check accepted.\
Tyson may be convinced to accept bitcoin. Paul will gladly accept
bitcoin, mostly to tease Enki.

Boats
-----

We have four boats in our fleet, organized by level of exuberance. Feel
free to switch places with someone mid-festival if you find you prefer a
different boat. Each boat needs to be decorated on the inside and
outside, to be easily recognizable.\
 Let's use this space to brainstorm decorations:

-   Carpets and rugs for the roofs
-   Fabric tapestries
-   Flags
-   Poles with cloth streamers
-   Reflective metallic ponchos
-   Interior: Twister boards on the walls.
-   Rope lights on the railing
-   Hanging LED lanterns (I'm bringing 6- Megan)
-   cushions everywhere
-   EL wire spider web

Embarkation
-----------

Here's Paradise Point Marina, where Strawberry Neptune will board our
houseboats on Thursday morning and set sail around noon: [Paradise Point
Marina](http://goo.gl/maps/WZtr)

If you intend to arrive after we've set sail at noon on Thursday, make
arrangements with Chris R. or Terry F., who will be running ferry
service to the festival for a moderate fee (a \$20.00 donation is
suggested). They'll pick up and drop off at H&H Marina: [H&H
Marina](http://goo.gl/maps/39Vg). Note that the ski boat is not allowed
to be operated after dark.

For ski boat (faster, less cargo) contact Chris Rasch: crasch@gmail.com,
650 773 6419. For patio boat (slower, more cargo) contact Terry Floyd:
terry.floyd@gmail.com, (510) 207-442

Here's the spreadsheet for people to make ferry arrangements to and from
the festival. [Ephemerisle boat ride coordination
spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=tOpwZyaD0C_Wl1PD4gJmqLA&authkey=CPWRkYQD#gid=0)

The festival location:
[<http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://maps.google.com/maps/ms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26hl%3Den%26msa%3D0%26ll%3D38.052957>,-121.538486%26spn%3D0.071912,0.139561%26msid%3D100718037888704317369.0004864803082020221ed%26source%3Dembed
Ephemerisle] We'll anchor there until Sunday afternoon, and then cruise
back to Paradise Point to return the boats by 5 p.m.

We'll board the boats at 9:30 a.m., cook breakfast there while still
docked, and have a nice little family meal before we set forth between
11 and noon. It will take a few hours to cruise to the festival site and
get our boats properly anchored and rafted together.

**Early Crew:** Paul: I will be arriving at Paradise Point marina at
9:00 to fill out the houseboat paperwork. At 9:30, I'll have a marina
employee go through a checklist and do a 30-minute houseboat
orientation. If others can be there for that, it would be great.
Knowledge is good stuff. Each boat will have an Officer of Welcome, who
will be in charge of orienting the newcomers as they arrive. At 10:00,
I'm going to send one houseboat ahead with Ratha and her platform
building crew, to get started on building the central platform. If
everyone is ready before noon, we'll launch early. There will be a lot
of work to do building the city: helping with the central platform,
anchoring the boats, rafting the boats together. Who will be at Paradise
Point at 9:30?

1.  Paul
2.  Ping
3.  Tyson
4.  Kristy

-   Clothing for hot and cold weather.
-   Small flashlight
-   Phone charger (assuming you have a phone)
-   Earplugs

The filtered water on the boat is fine. I happily drank it for four days
straight, and it was delicious. And it's a really big tank. So it's
probably a good idea to save space and not bring any extra water, unless
you're really addicted to bottles.(Paul)

Take a moment to review the [Survival
Guide](http://www.unephemerisle.org/wiki/Survival_guide). [Further
suggestions](http://wiki.seasteading.org/index.php/Ephemerisle_Houseboat_Info#Some_things_to_bring)

Food
----

Have a look at the [kitchen
resources](http://www.sevencrown.com/houseboats/summit.htm) available on
each boat. There will be a gas range, gas oven, microwave oven, propane
BBQ, and a whole lot of cookware. If memory serves, the fridge doesn't
get very cold. So it's generally best to use the ice chest as much as
possible.

Convenient grocery store: [Safeway](http://goo.gl/maps/Ovm8) 2808
Country Club, Stockton, CA 95204

### Preferred Food Plan Method

1.  The Anastasia Alternative, outlined below.

:   
    :   Everyone picks one favourite dish and brings all the ingredients
        to feed themselves that meal for the entire duration. That is to
        say, if your favourite meal is Chinese Chicken Salad, bring
        enough supplies to make 12 servings [3 meals a day for 4 days].
        This ensures that when all is said and done, we all collectively
        have enough food to feed everyone the entire time, no more and
        no less. Also, this creates a variety of food available at any
        one time.

:   
    :   Next step: upon arrival, everyone puts their food on their boat.
        Each boat then decides who cooks when; as a professional chef,
        Anastasia volunteers to help out any boats that find themselves
        shorthanded. Boats can divide up the work so each person cooks
        one meal, rotating turns, whatever. Make a chart or something.

:   
    :   Coordinate with your own boat to make sure that no-one brings
        the same thing you do. Try to focus on foods that can be cooked
        and put in the fridge, things that can be made by one's self,
        etc. For example, salads [with dressing on the side!], soup,
        sandwich making materials, et cetera. Feel free to prep stuff at
        home to save time and hassle on the trip; if your fave meal is a
        BLT, cook the bacon beforehand and put it in a plastic bag. That
        way, when someone wants a BLT, all they have to do is put it
        together, and when it's lunchtime, we can just open the fridge
        rather that having some poor bastard try to cook for a dozen
        people.

### Alternative Food Plan Methods

1.  A designated food official goes shopping on Thursday morning and
    gets a lot of stuff. Then...
2.  Everyone for themselves.
3.  Hire a cook for the duration of the event
4.  Per boat, each person is responsible for preparing one meal that
    will feed the whole crew, bringing all supplies necessary. (This
    automatically shares the cost of food, but assumes a fixed crew.)

### Specific Meal Schemes

#### Mildly Rambunctious:

-   Anastasia - salad supplies, and possibly some meaty things to keep
    separate but which can be added to said salad for omnivores. Also,
    hella salad dressings. She will also be making vegetable stock soup
    with udon noodles, mushrooms, and other yummy things. The soup will
    contain egg, sorry vegans, but it will be cage free ethical egg. :)
-   Desiree - suggests: hella oatmeal for healthy win breakfast? Also
    will bring for meal: Aidell's precooked artichoke-garlic or habanero
    chicken sausages (still taste better fried), lentil-soup, Amy's
    awesome canned tofu-chili & vegetable barley soup for emergencies.
    Magic Bullet blender for A's hummus. Also requested peppers, blue
    and raspberries from JZ on his Costco trip since we all want fruit &
    veggies.
-   Cj - fixings for tacos-- beanie or chicken.
-   Sailor Scott - I'm bringing cans of Steaz Tea, Lundberg Brown Rice
    Chips, Imagine Soap (no one wanted to correct me-so I guess it's
    bubble blowing in between bites)or Imagine Butternut Squash Soup and
    Apple Lentil Soup(whichever you prefer), Brown Rice. Would love to
    help make Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. Anyone interested in Veggie
    Patties? A trip to Costco to pick up fruit with someone or farmer's
    market. What cooking pots or untensils are needed? I will bring pots
    or other implements to cook...just let me know. Plus seasonings. I
    have an excellent cook book for grilling and vegan meals too!
-   Tyson - Breakfast of Champions, AKA Brunch. - Scrambled eggs and
    omelets with various fillings. A 24 egg pallet should be adequate
    for one breakfast. Also, pineapple and cantaloupe make nice
    additions. Who will bring the champagne? Sailor Scott has a bottle
    of Sparkling Wine aka champagne already packed.
-   JZ - Grilled Cheez Sammiches, along with tomato bisque soup. Will
    include pickles & mustard. Also snacks such as tortilla chips and
    fresh fruit.
-   Darryl - Rotisserie Chicken. Also bringing tea, crackers, trail mix
    and some drinks of some sort.

Meal Ideas Unclaimed

-   Kababs - Make use of that grill and the propane
-   Pizza - Bring pizza dough, sauce and toppings (Suggestion: you can
    get uncooked pizza pies from Whole Foods)
-   General snacks are always a good idea. (Smores!!!)

#### Moderately Shenaniganistic:

-   Paul: Exotic waffles. (By the way, I'm bored with oatmeal. If
    someone brings oats, I'll protest by baking them into a waffle with
    cheddar cheese and curry powder.) Chocolate, beer.
-   Kristy: The best soup in the world! Cinnamon cookies with extra
    cinnamon. (Sailor Scott will trade for cinnamon cookies)
-   Ping: French toast, maple syrup, veggie bacon. For twelve. Yum!

#### Exuberant:

-   Stephanie: I'm bringing the oatmeal. Also SUPERFOODS!
-   Chris R: Salad fixings! Lot's of salad fixings. (Requests welcome.)

Learn Something Before
----------------------

-   Knots
    -   [Cleat Hitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MauqAdKA0Q0) - If
        you only learn one knot before you go, it should be this one.
        Useful for tying your boat up to cleats on the dock, or tying
        two boats together at their cleats.
    -   [Other potentially useful
        knots](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLD29586453BA90B7C)
        include Figure Eight, Bowline, Sheet Bend, Square Knot, & Clove
        Hitch.

warmup (or evening release) and an introduction to gentle yet truly
invigorating stretches that even the most reductionistic among us can
explore and enjoy.

Hatha Playground: So you know where your hands and feet go in downward
facing dog... you think. Ok, it's alright if you still don't know what
Parivritta-parshvakona-asana means. You're willing to try it, and you
like how it feels. If you're digging this stretch and balance thing,
come play with us. We'll start with a warm up, invigorating flow, and
end with extensive open play and sharing of different poses and
variations.

Bring: comfy clothes that don't catch, water, a washcloth/small towel,
mat if you have it. If not: don't worry! We'll improvise as needed. =)

### Crafting Session

**Paul:** Pipe cleaners, pens and paper, tape\
**trebor:** i'll bring PCL (aka shapelock or instamorph) and a heat
gun\*. this stuff is great for ad-hock connectors, to hang stuff, for
random repairs to costumes or whatever. i've gotten pretty good at
fabricating stuff and love a challenge. \* - the heat gun requires power
which may be in short supply. any source of heat will do, we'll see what
works in the environment.

### Minor Acts of Piracy

1.  Surreptitiously affixing googley eyes to the unattended fruits and
    vegetables on other boats.
2.  Hoisting purloined undies up the mainmast

5.  Regrets
6.  Dinosaurs

And miniworkshops by Christine Peterson requested to central platform,
potential topics including:

1.  Life Extension
2.  Finding Love and a Life Partner
3.  Moving Your Career Toward Nanotech
4.  Protecting Yourself Financially From Government Screwups

### Osculation Appreciation Hour

A party for people who like kissing. Get permission before actually
smooching anyone. Hosted by the Mary Ellen Carter, in the play tunnel.\

Bringing the weed: Paul\
Will help organize: Paul\
What to use as a prize?\

### DDR Possibility

Max: PS2, DDR, and two DDR mats\
Someone else: A SP2 compatible TV\
Tyson: Power strips, extension cord.\
Paul: I don't like this activity so much, because TV's are bulky. But it
would be amusing to see people actually playing DDR out on a floating
wooden platform. Perhaps if there's a projector and screen in the works
already, we could use that. Also, Strawberry Neptune doesn't have a
platform, so we'd have to make arrangements with someone else.

### Disco Inferno Possibility

funky disco lights and a smoke machine. (Stanton?) That's affirmative!
Kind of recession style on the lights and smoke, but Jaime and I will be
DJ'ing! -Stanton

### Water Polo Game

(Perhaps with Innertubes) improvised helmets optional???
