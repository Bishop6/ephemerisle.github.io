Community platform (central stage)
----------------------------------

For Ephemerisle 2011, we built a floating platform that was shared
amongst the participants for holding common events (dancing,
[microtalks](ephemerisle_2011_microtalks.html), camp fire), or just to
mingle. Learning from past experiences in building floating platforms
(e.g. Apocaisle in 2010) we aimed to create an MVP: Minimal Viable
Platform.

Design
------

The platform measured 24x20ft, could hold 50 people, and was built out
of 9 identical
modules.[1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ratha/5837270141/in/photostream/)
Each module floated on top of 6 [Home Depot Tough Box 27-Gallon

([mirror](http://www.webcitation.org/5zWvYmUJj)) heavy duty plastic
bins, sealed with duct tape or in plastic bags. The bins were easily
available from Home Depot, affordable (\$13 each), stackable for
transport, and provided lots of lift. On the downside, they leaked, and
had to be sealed. The cost was 20lbs of lift per \$. Assembling the
entire platform took 5
hours.[2](http://nasu-dengaku.livejournal.com/372390.html)
