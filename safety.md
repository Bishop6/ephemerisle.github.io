Preparing for safety
--------------------

(Chris, Matt, Adam, Isaac, Dave, Terry, Becca, Robert, Helen, Tammy,

-   Meet before the event for safety training: first aid, divemaster
    training, what to do when someone falls in the water in the dark.
    Plan this on the [Upcoming Events](upcoming-events.html) page.

-   Half-hour general safety lesson over the PA (e.g. reserve time on
    Friday afternoon): "here's how you take care of other people"

Some folks take an effort to gain safety knowledge, but don't advertise
themselves as "official safety personnel" too loudly. Don't let others
assume that "safety experts" will take care of things for them.

We need lights for boats traveling at night.
