While taking apart the city there were a lot of very bad knots.
Generally speaking a good knot not only holds whatever it is designed
to, but is also easy to untie. Knots on top of knots on top of knots,
shows a lack of confidence that the original knot will hold.

The two knots everyone at Ephemerisle should know:

-   [Bowline](http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/) - The best simple
    loop knot. Puts a non-slip loop in the end of a rope, can be used to
    tie off to a post or rail.
    -   Advantages
        -   Quick to tie
        -   Easy to untie
        -   Many useful variants
    -   Disadvantages
        -   Difficult to tie in a rope that's under load
        -   Should generally only go around one thing at a time - "ring
            loading," where two things inside the loop pull in different
            directions, can cause it to slip.
        -   It's not safe to add a load to the trailing end
-   [Cleat Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/cleatdeck/) - Used for
    attaching anchors lines or dock lines to a cleat.
    -   The basic hitch for tying to a cleat. On a poorly-shaped
        houseboat cleat, adding a stopper knot (figure-eight) to the end
        of the line, or adding a second tucked turn at the end, can make
        it more secure.

Other knots which are good to know:

-   [Taut-line Hitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taut-line_hitch) -
    makes an adjustable loop around a post or rail. Unlike a bowline,
    can be easily tied while there is a heavy load on the rope. May
    tighten down if loaded unevenly. Use variant 1855 from the linked
    page.
-   [Butterfly
    Knot](http://www.animatedknots.com/alpinebutterfly/index.php) - Make
    a non-slip loop in the middle of a line that can be safely loaded
    from either or both directions. Can be tied without access to the
    rope end.
-   [Butterfly Bend](http://www.animatedknots.com/alpinebend/index.php)
    - A bend is a knot used to join two rope ends. If you know how to
    tie a butterfly knot, you can use the same technique to make one of
    the best bends. It's strong, secure, easy, and easily untied.
-   [Figure 8](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8_/) - Stopper knot
    (keeps the free end from slipping through your other knot) - you can
    use this on the loose end when tying a cleat hitch in slippery rope
    on a crappy houseboat cleat. Leave a tail a few inches long.
-   [Fisherman's Knot](http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermans/) -
    A good way of attaching two lines together, but very hard to untie
    after loading
-   ![True Reef Knot](http://www.2020site.org/knots/images/knots2.gif) -
    A good temporary knot which will hold somewhat well, but comes
    undone with one pull. Use as a binding knot for tying up a bundle,
    but not as a bend. If you want a slipped bend, try a [Slipped Sheet
    Bend](http://www.netplaces.com/knots/tying-bends/slipped-sheet-bend.htm)
-   [Trucker's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/) - provides
    mechanical advantage for tightening the line - There are a lot of
    different trucker's hitches. The linked site shows a version of the
    trucker's hitch that jams horribly under load. Use the same
    technique, but start with a butterfly knot so you can untie it
    afterward. Better yet, get me (Noah) to show you a knot called "The
    Dutchman." The few illustrations I can find of it are either poor or
    wrong, so I might have to make my own video.
-   [Clove Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/clove/) - Quick,
    temporary hitch for a post [or
    railing](http://www.animatedknots.com/cloveend/). Tends to work
    itself loose if left unattended, but ok if you just need a quick
    hitch to hold a line for a few seconds. It's the first step in tying
    a double constrictor knot, which is an extremely secure hitch, but
    difficult to untie.
