<b>Watertight Plastic Bins</b>

-   Pros: stackable, portable, watertight
-   Cons: more expensive, how best to attach to platform without
    compromising watertightness - is more-watertight really needed over
    standard bins?

From my observation during the teardown this year, I think the bins with
tape stayed dry and attached the best... those all appeared to be in
good order, while some of the bag-wrapped ones seemed to have become
flooded during the event. (I had to rescue one of hte bagged bins -
early Sunday morning? - that had come loose and was drifting away with
its bag half-full of water: I had to slice the bag to let the water out
before I could lift it over the edge of the platform.) -dw
