Ephemerisle 2011
================

![](images/2011_map.jpg "fig:") Ephemerisle 2011 took place during Jun
9-12, in the same location as the previous two years - the Mandeville
Tip County Park on the [Sacramento – San Joaquin River
Delta](wikipedia:sacramento_–_san_joaquin_river_delta.html)
([<http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=207854270338809155245.0004864803082020221ed&ll=38.058837>,-121.539345&spn=0.047915,0.098791&z=11
map]).

After having to rebrand the event "NotEphmerisle" (or "UnEphemerisle")
last year due to insurance and legal technicalities, this year [The
Seasteading Institute](http://seasteading.org) did not officially
attempt to organize the event and let us use the name "Ephemerisle". We
rented out every houseboat in the region, built a 20x24 [floating
platform](community-platform.html), brought around 200 people, and made
the event an unequivocal success.

Read **Matt Bell's excellent [summary of Ephemerisle
2011](http://nasu-dengaku.livejournal.com/372390.html)**. Paul Bohm also
write his [thoughts on what made Ephemerisle a great occasion to
connect](http://paulbohm.com/ephemerisle-2011-summary/).
