**Event updates:**

Sign up for the @ephem12 Twitter account for event updates.

If you don't actively use Twitter but want to receive announcements,
text "follow ephem12" to 40404 with your phone. You'll get a text
message anytime someone makes an announcement. If you want to broadcast
an announcement, you'll need a Twitter account, but it takes just a
couple of minutes to set up if you don't already have one. Once you have
an account, just make a tweet "@ephem12 [your message]" and the system
will automatically broadcast your message to all the attendees who have
signed up.

Radio FMerile will be broadcasting at 95.3 FM.
