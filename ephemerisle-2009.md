Ephemerisle 2009
================

The first Ephemerisle was held on October 2-4th, and located just SE of
where [Disappointment
Slough](http://marinas.com/view/inlet/301_Disappointment_Slough_Inlet_CA_United_States)
(which extends to Paradise Point Marina) meets the main channel,
[<https://maps.google.com/maps/myplaces?ll=38.032805>,-121.467966&spn=0.005738,0.009474&ctz=420&t=h&z=17
as seen on this Google Map]. The event was sponsored & run by [The
Seasteading Institute](http://seasteading.org), with central platforms
built by [Chicken John Rinaldi](http://chickenjohn.com/) and his
hard-working crew, who built a work boat and crane for the operation.

The event amassed 9 houseboats and a community-built platform anchored
to the shore. A variety of art projects were funded by TSI. The event
attracted media attention and was the subject of [a
documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pmTM9hh_qM) by Stanford
Film Master's student Jason
Sussberg.[1](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504383_162-5377477-504383.html)

Perhaps most importantly, it was successful enough to lead to community
interest and growth in future years. See the participant reports below
for personal experiences.

-   For 2+ years, Ephemerisle 2009 (picture taken Friday, before full
    combining of boats/platforms) was in the Google Maps satellite image
    for that location, it was lots of fun to show it to people in their
    Google Maps :). As of 2012, the image has been updated and
    Ephemerisle is no longer there.
